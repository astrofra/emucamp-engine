			Oric was the name used by Tangerine Computer Systems for a series of home computers, including the original Oric-1, its successor the Oric Atmos and the later Oric Stratos/IQ164 and Oric Telestrat models.<br>
<br>
With the success of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Tangerine's backers had suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop and release the Oric-1 in 1983. Further computers in the Oric range were released through to 1987 with Eastern European clones being produced into the 1990s.

				Amoric is a low-level emulator for Amiga with kickstart 2.04 or higher and with a 68020 or faster CPU.

To run Amoric at a correct speed, you'll need at least a 68030/50MHz, but to get a really oric feeling, a 68040 is better.
