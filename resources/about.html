					Created by Zoop/Bock in 1997, managed by a large team and administrated MetaFox 'til 2008, now maintained by Astrofra, this website aims to list the latest computer and console emulators.
                    <br><br>
                    In december 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080705104047/http://emucamp.com/" target="_blank">according to Archive.org</a>, Emucamp.com ceased to function. Around november 2013, seeing that it was hold in parking, I reclaimed the domain name to rebuild a humble thesaurus of emulators, with the help of a <a href="http://astrofra.github.io/emucamp-engine/" target="_blank">Python script</a> that would crawl the hundreds of different emulation sources, in order to keep the content updated.
                    <br><br>
                    Trying to understand what Emucamp was all about, I found the bits of history below, told by the people who used to make and visit the site since its creation.

              <div><a href="/title/Emulation" title="Emulation" class='populated' >Emulation</a> website hosted on <a href="/title/Emulation+World" title="Emulation World" class='populated' >Emulation World</a>. Traditionally has a very old-school focus, favouring <a href="/title/8-bit+systems" title="8-bit systems" class='populated' >8-bit systems</a> over next-gen stuff.
<br><br>
The site was founded by <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Zoop" title="Zoop" target="_blank" >Zoop</a>, later to become authour of <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Meka" title="Meka" target="_blank" >Meka</a>, in 1997 with the title <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Sega+Master+System" title="Sega Master System" target="_blank" >Master System</a> Camp. The site later switched to cover other platforms, but the <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Sega" title="Sega" target="_blank" >Sega</a> bias continued, with a new site design mimicking the level opening screens from <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Sonic+2" title="Sonic 2" target="_blank" >Sonic 2</a>.
<br><br>
The site became popular due to a number of features. Firstly, the design is very different to most <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Emu" title="Emu" target="_blank" >Emu</a> sites; asides from being colourful, it was designed to be fully viewable on machines running at <a href="http://everything2.com/title/640x480" title="640x480" target="_blank" >640x480</a> resolution, all of which was in keeping with the <a href="http://everything2.com/title/lo-tech" title="lo-tech" target="_blank" >lo-tech</a> air of the site.  Secondly, the staff were both dedicated and actively involved in the Emu scene, with members like <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Zoop" title="Zoop" target="_blank" >Zoop</a>, <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Spinner-8" title="Spinner-8" target="_blank" >Spinner-8</a>, <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Roni" title="Roni" target="_blank" >Roni</a> and <a href="http://everything2.com/title/lilac" title="lilac" target="_blank" >lilac</a> keeping their fingers very much on the pulse. Lastly, the news posts had personality; not just the bland <a href="http://everything2.com/title/C%2526P" title="C&P" target="_blank" >C&P</a> approach used at places like <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Dave%2527s+Classics" title="Dave's Classics" target="_blank" >Dave's Classics</a>. The site also boasted a mightly file library, which was updated constantly, rather than just linking to the emu <a href="http://everything2.com/title/homepage" title="homepage" target="_blank" >homepage</a>.
<br><br>
Then came <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Uzplayer" title="Uzplayer" target="_blank" >Uzplayer</a>. I won't go into details, but during his tenancy at the site, all the old staff left, the site went to shit, Zoop left, then the old staff launched a <a href="http://everything2.com/title/coup" title="coup" target="_blank" >coup</a> to take the site back (basically breaking in and changing the locks), Uzplayer hung around the messageboards like a bad smell.
<br><br>
The site's a bit listless now. The old staff never quite got their enthusiasm back (or never <i>came</i> back after the whole Uzplayer thing), Zoop's more busy with <a href="http://everything2.com/title/SMS+Power" title="SMS Power" target="_blank" >SMS Power</a> and Meka, and the new staff members that pop up and leave now and again are rather of the bland variety. The file library has been defunct for a long time now.
<br><br>
It's a shame. Still, worth a look. <b>http://www.emucamp.com</b>.

		<B>The end of Emulation Camp Part II</B><BR>
		Well it seems like the other co-maintainers will continue the maintenacnce of Emulation Camp, woohoo, unfortunately however minus Zoop :-(
		Also a English <A HREF="http://purplesky.simplenet.com/emucamp/" TARGET="_blank">translated</A> version of Zoop's departing message is now available on Emulation Camp for all of you to read.
		<P><br>
		<B>The end of Emulation Camp</B><BR>
		Well it seems like another great emulation site is going to be disappearing from the scene, that's right, Zoop ( maintainer of the <A HREF="http://purplesky.simplenet.com/emucamp/" TARGET="_blank">Emulation Camp</A> site ) has
		decided to call it quits. The reasons for his departure from the scene are set out on the Emulation Camp home page, so please take the time to read it because it is quite lengthy. If the other co-maintainers decide to continue maintaining the site then Emulation Camp
		will still exist ( minus Zoop of course ) otherwise Emulation Camp will be no more. I would just like take this time to say good luck Zoop on whatever you set out to do in the
		future and you and your site ( if it's not to be continued ) will be deeply missed from the emulation scene.</div>

              <div><p><b>SMS Power!</b> is a fan website dedicated to the games, hardware and various media of the <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sega_Master_System" title="Sega Master System" target="_blank">Sega Master System</a> (SMS) / <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/SG-1000_Mark_III" title="SG-1000 Mark III" target="_blank">Sega Mark III</a> (MK3), <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sega_Game_Gear" title="Sega Game Gear" target="_blank">Sega Game Gear</a> (GG), <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/SG-1000" title="SG-1000" target="_blank">Sega Game 1000</a> (SG-1000), <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/SC-3000" title="SC-3000" target="_blank">Sega Computer 3000</a> (SC-3000), <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/SF-7000" title="SF-7000" target="_blank">Sega Super Control Station</a> (SF-7000) and the Othello Multivision (OMV), all <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Zilog" title="Zilog" target="_blank">Zilog</a> <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Z80" title="Z80" target="_blank">Z80</a> <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sega" title="Sega" target="_blank">Sega</a> <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/8-bit_era" title="8-bit era" target="_blank">8-bit era</a> systems. The site was founded at the end of March 1997, first under the name <b>"SMS Camp"</b>. It later evolved into a generic emulation site called <b>"Emulation Camp"</b> then split, went back into focus and was renamed to "SMS Power!" in 1999.
</p><p>SMS Power! aims to archive the software data for all Sega 8-bit era systems, analyze and sort the software and release it to the public. For this reason, the site is perhaps best known for its collection of rare and hard-to-find <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/ROM" title="ROM" target="_blank">ROM</a> dumps. In addition to dumping, which is becoming an easier process nowadays, lots of work is put into verifying and labeling new and existing data, and comparing variations that may exist between different countries or rereleases. This is a tedious job, often requiring deep knowledge of the games and analysis based on the original box, game media, documentation, or reverse engineering program code.
</p><p>Additionally, the site hosts an active forum, fansites for <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Alex_Kidd" title="Alex Kidd" target="_blank">Alex Kidd</a>, Golvellius, and <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Wonder_Boy" title="Wonder Boy" target="_blank">Wonder Boy</a>, as well as the official website for <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/MEKA" title="MEKA" target="_blank">MEKA</a>.
