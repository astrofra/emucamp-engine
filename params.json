","body":"A scripted toolchain to automatically update a database of listed emulators, including each binary of each version.\r\n\r\n![Emucamp Logo](http://www.emucamp.com/assets/logo_emu_camp_white_400px.png)\r\n\r\n# The project is divided in two parts\r\n\r\n1. The Engine\r\n2. The website\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole engine is open-sourced in order to avoid the complete oblivion in case the maintainer is not able to work anymore on the project.\r\n\r\n## 1. The Engine\r\n\r\nThe Engine is a set of Python scripts able to crawl on a given list of sources, fetch any updated data, and download the data that changed since the last run. The sources are described using simple text files with a very basic syntax.\r\n\r\nOnce the run is done, the result is a tree of folders, containing each version of each emulator, sorted by original machines (C64, CPC, Amiga, Atari...)\r\n\r\nEach machine (or emulator) shows a description in English language, extracted from Wikipedia.\r\nThe excract can be automated using the Wikipedia API.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page\r\n\r\nEach emulator can be downloaded using one or several urls.\r\nThe binaries could be either :\r\n- directly linked to the original emulator's site\r\n- downloaded from the site and hosted on emucamp.net\r\n- found by the visitors by following an external link to the original emulator's website\r\n\r\n## 2. The website\r\n\r\nThe website is a static site (pure HTML, no PHP, no SQL). Everything is built on the local machine that runs the engine, and then uploaded to a given location.\r\n\r\nThe files is a mix or html, css, png and binary files.
